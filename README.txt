Review: The paper proposes a novel machine learning method for failure identification in microwave networks. The proposed method employ general ML algorithms (ANN, SVM, RF) to classify 6 classes failure root-cause happening in microwave networks, and meanwhile, use KNN and Gaussian Processes to label of unlabeled points as a data augment measure to improve performance of classifier. The experimental results show that the method achieve satisfying accuracy on the synthetic dataset.
